**JP Morgan & Chase Co. Stock Trends Prediction Neural Network**
- **Model Design & Development:** Engineered a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python in Google Colab to predict JP Morgan & Chase Co. stock trends
- **Learning Curve:** Acquired foundational knowledge on RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), including the backpropagation algorithm and the “vanishing gradient” for real-world time-series problem-solving
- **Data Manipulation & Visualization:** Leveraged Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and sklearn for data normalization, feature engineering, etc. to enhance model prediction accuracy and assessment of model performance 
**Deployment & User Interface Development:** Deployed the prediction model and created an intuitive interface using Streamlit
